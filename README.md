# MergeSortAlgo

This is the implementation of **Merge Sort Algorithm** in Python. 

## How it Works

- Prompts the user to enter 5 input size values (e.g. if 1000, this is the number of values to be sorted). 
- Calculates the time complexity (in **seconds/milliseconds**) for each of the input size values.
- The program will randomly pick 1000 numbers (if your input was 1000), sort them using Merge Sort and calculate the time complexity.
- Displays each of the time complexities.

There are 2 files: one calculates in seconds(s) while the other does so in milliseconds(ms).
