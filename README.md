# MergeSortAlgo

This is the implementation of Merge Sort Algorithm in Python. 

It prompts the user to enter 5 input size values (e.g. if 1000, this is the number of values to be sorted). 
It then calculates the time complexity (in seconds/milliseconds) for each of the input size values. The program will randomly pick 1000 numbers (if your input was 1000), sort them using merge sort and calculates the time complexity.

It finally displays each of the time complexities.

There are 2 files: one calculates in seconds(s) while the other does so in milliseconds(ms).
